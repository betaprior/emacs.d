  (require 'matlab-load)

* Finding Updates

** Releases

   The most recent version of matlab.el is always in CVS.

   The last stabilized version of matlab.el can be found on MATLAB Central:

   Category:
   http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/loadCategory.do?objectId=19&objectType=Category
   This File
   http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/loadFile.do?objectId=104&objectType=file

   Older versions of matlab.el can be found as matlab.el.1.10.1
   for emacsen that do not have the latest additional utilities such
   as tempo and derived.

   matlab.el and mlint.el has shipped on MATLAB CDs starting with 6.5
   (R13).  Updates after a release of MATLAB will be made to MATLAB
   Central and announced on the mailing list.

   matlab.el and mlint.el will no longer ship on MATLAB CDs starting
   with MATLAB release R2008b.  If you are using a version of MATLAB
   from before R2008a, you will want to use the version of mlint from
   that CD.

** CVS

   matlab-emacs is available via CVS from SourceForge.

   Homepage:
   http://matlab-emacs.sf.net

   Project Page:
   http://sourceforge.net/projects/matlab-emacs

   CVS Repository:
   http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=154105

** Dependancies

   MATLAB-Emacs now requires the CEDET suite for the following items:
	- Modifying the build system (Makefiles, etc)
	- mlint (uses EIEIO object system)
	- parsing/completion (uses semantic parsing system)

   See http://cedet.sf.net for downloading CEDET.

   If you only want to use matlab.el for editing code, you DO NOT need to install CEDET.
