# General info

This is my emacs configuration repository. The main configuration is stored
in org format (as described on
http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/intro.html) in
init.el.org. Functions in init.el just prepare the org file for loading. 

Note that this bootstrapping process is sensitive to org-mode versions. Until
Org 7.8 starts shipping with Emacs, it is recommended to replace org sources
that come with emacs with byte-compiled versions of Org 7.8.
